Assignment to develop a html page using semantic html

Semantic Code means code that is easy to draw logicor meaning from.
This is particularly important with HTML, as Screen Readers use Semantic HTML tags to navigate and draw meaning from a web page for visually impaired users.
Search engine web crawlers also use HTML tags to get information from your page (for example the information in a pages <title> tags) to rank web pages in search results.
Using Semantic HTML makes web pages more accessible

For this task, you will be given a set of User Specifications/Business Requirements.
ðŸ‘‰ Your job is to build an HTML page following these user specifications/business requirements using Semantic HTML only. The specifications are deliberately vague - itâ€™s your job to identify which HTML elements would be the most appropriate to use!
ðŸ‘‰ The submission we are looking for is just an .html file in a GitHub repository

This task is about Semantic HTML only. You do NOT need to use any CSS.
You donâ€™t need to make the whole page function! Itâ€™s okay if the nav bars donâ€™t work, and you donâ€™t have to setup a HTTP server to serve the HTML or handle navigations or anything like that.

ðŸ’¡ If you want to use this assignment as an excuse to setup a very simple development HTTP server and have your HTML pages navigate to each other correctly, then have fun! But it is NOT required.

Correct usage of Semantic HTML â€“ can you justify your choice of HTML tags and attributes? Are you using semantic/appropriate elements e.g. instead of wrapping everything in lots of divs, could there be a better element to use like a <section> or <article> tag?
Have you tested your code in any way (e.g. the W3C MarkUp Validator https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input and/or Google Chromes Lighthouse)?
Could you navigate your page without using a mouse?
Have you used alt tags? What description have you chosen to use (if any at all) and why?
